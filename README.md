The paper proposes a new way of robust location detection using identifying codes (i.e                            
uniquely identifying locations based on a unique ID for each location) and also minimizing the                              
number of sensors needed to do so. The problem of minimizing the number of sensors required                                
to optimally, uniquely locate all the location is a NP-complete problem and the paper provides a                                
polynomial time solution based on greedy method.
